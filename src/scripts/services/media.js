 * 
 * Dispatcher is used to broadcast payloads to registered callbacks. This is
 * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways: - Callbacks are not
 * subscribed to particular events. Every payload is dispatched to every
 * registered callback. - Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other
 * callbacks have been executed.
