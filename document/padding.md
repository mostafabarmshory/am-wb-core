# Padding 

In the current model of contents, We save the setting of margin in: **style.padding**.  

Here, There is an example which shows how the padding is stored in style:

    {
        "type": "Group",
        "style": {
            "padding": "10px 2px 10px 5px"
        }
    }

## Definition and Usage

The 4 padding properties are used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). These properties are:

- margin-top

- margin-right

- margin-bottom

- margin-left

All the padding properties can have the following values:

- length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.

- % - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element

- inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element

### Important note: Negative values are allowed.
