# Margin 

In the current model of contents, We save the setting of margin in: **style.margin**.  

Here, There is an example which shows how the margin is stored in style:

    {
        "type": "Group",
        "style": {
            "margin": "10px 2px 10px 5px"
        }
    }

## Definition and Usage

The 4 margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). These properties are:

- margin-top

- margin-right

- margin-bottom

- margin-left

All the margin properties can have the following values:

- auto - the browser calculates the margin

- length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.

- % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element

- inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element

### Important note: Negative values are allowed.
