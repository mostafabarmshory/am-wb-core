# Textarea


The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control.

A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).

The size of a text area can be specified by the cols and rows attributes, or even better; through CSS' height and width properties.
